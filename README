PKT Type: This field denotes the type of packet being transmitted. 
There are three possible packet types: begin, normal, and end. Begin 
type contains the file name, and is the first packet to arrive 
to the receiver program. Normal type contains the packet content, and
the End type is the last packet to arrive to the receiver, containing 
the last of the packet content.  

Content Len: This value gives the length of the data of the packet, excluding
the length of the packet header. 

Offset: The offset field represents the offset in to the sending file 
that the content of the packet holds. 

Sequence Number: This field contains the number of the current window being transmitted.

Acknowledgement Number: This is a field exclusively used by the receiver 
program. It contains the number of the window of the packet that was just
received from the sender, and uses this field to acknowledge that windows' 
reception and writing to file. 

Checksum: This field holds the checksum value calculated from the header, 
minus the checksum fields, and the entire sending file. This is used to
detect if a packet has been mangled in the transmission process.

Checksum(Cont.): A continuation of the first checksum field; because 
the checksum value is 128 bits, two 64-bit fields were needed.

Data: The contents of the packet being sent.

Algorithms:
====================
sliding window, 

Properties/Features:
====================
We added and implemented the fast retransmission feature into our protocol. Instead of necessarily
waiting for a missing acknowledgement message from the receiver, and thus wait for a timeout in
order to resend the packet, we implemented fast transmission so that if the sender receives three
ACK messages in a row, it immediately resends the packet. This allows for faster recovery from
timeout situations, and thus increases our performance. 

Running the Code:
====================
The syntax for launching our code is the same as the commands given in the design document.

To launch the sender program:
	sendfile -r <recv_host>:<recv_port> -f <filename>

To launch the receiver program:
	recvfile -p <recv_port>
